# Fishy
Fishy allows users to send crypto currency in a safe environment. A user can input a wallet address and the trained neural network will return a credibility score that represents the likelihood of the address being malicious. <br> The frontend was built using react and the backend is a flask api. The neural network was built and trained using tensor flow on data from [Ethereum Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vagifa/ethereum-frauddetection-dataset).
